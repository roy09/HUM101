We don't really know if Indus is a valid script. We found steatite seals with markings what we call indus script. This markings may be interpreated as indus scirpts. more recently however as we failed to understand anything the markings as script, it might not be a script at all. some people guess this markings signify ownership or something that helped with trading. 

many of markings do not repeat itself. had it been a script, there would have been many repatatons in the pattern of the script. however that has not really been the case.

so the current belief is, there was no indus script. previously we thought they wrote, but now we don't think that anymore.
