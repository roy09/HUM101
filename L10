	Upanishads
	Challenged Brahman religious institutions
	Refused to recognize Vedic gods
	Rejected religious rituals such as sacrifice to appease gods
	God as an universal concept, not a superhuman creature

[People are started to get critical on Vedas. Upanishads has certain parts that criticize the Vedas. Kshatriyas didn't like
how Brahman in the top of moral authority. By rejecting the religious rituals, they rejected the Brahmin's too]

Emphasis on cyclic rebirth (samsara)

Liberation from cyclic rebirth(moksha) attained through adhering to certain moral principles.


[As writing developed, lower caste people were empowered. Now they could read and write.]

The Four Noble Truth (Not very important)

The cause of suffering - Desire
The cessation of suffering - Relinquishing

	not for peasants

Again, rejection of Vedic sacrifice and caste
