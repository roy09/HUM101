===================================================================================

Dissident Thinkers

Brahmins' claim to moral authority creates resentment

Dissidence arose from within the Vedic tradition
	Upanishads
	Challgenged Brahman religious institutions
	Refused to recognize Vedic gods
	Rejected religious rituals such as sacrifice to appease gods
	God as an universal concept, not a superhuman creature

[People are started to get critical on Vedas. Uponishad has certain parts that criticise the Upanishad. Kshatriyans didn't like
how Brahman in the top of moral authority. By rejecting the riligious rituals, they rejected the Brahmins too]

Emphasis on cyclic rebirth (samsara)

Liberation from cyclic rebirth(moksha) attained through adhering to certain moral principles.


[As writing developed, lower caste people were empowered. Now they could read and write.]

"Four noble truths" concerning suffering ("dukkha" in Pali)

The Buddha's teaching ("dhamma"): attaining nirvana through the eightfold path

Souls suffer through our interaction with the world, accumulating karma

Man's objective is to achieve moksha through asceticism

This is done through adherence, amongst other principles, to the crucial rule of ahmisa or strict non-violence
	mostly followed by traders nad city dwellers
	not for peasents

Again, rejection of Vedic sacrifice and caste

Most important schoool during this period for political reason.

==============================================================================
